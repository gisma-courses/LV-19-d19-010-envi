    "text": "Widely used in applications as diverse as urban planning, architectural design and energy efficiency, ENVI-met is a 3D micro-climate simulation software. Its functionality goes beyond individual climate parameters and covers a wide spectrum. ENVI-met excels in simulating different climate conditions, including day and night temperatures, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation in urban environments. It can also simulate the impact of different building materials, such as glass and stone, on the surrounding environment.\nThe course will cover the following topics\nBasic concepts Definition of materials Modelling vegetation Preparing the model for simulation Creation of weather files Running a simulation Visualising the results Interpreting the results"

Preferable at on a clearing to reduce impacts of falling branches or similar.  2.) One square meter around the box must be cleared of any vegetation and the A-horizon (depending on the slope, even more).\n 3.) Around this area a further strip with a diameter of at least 1 meter must also be cleared of organic material, especially leaves. Dig up the A-horizon and exclude roots and organic stuff. Note that the wiring sections must also be cleared of combustible organic material.\n 4.) Check cables and screws for proper seating and integrity.\n\n5.) Check proper installation of the solar panel. Mount the panel on a simple wooden slat attached to the frame to avoid damage to the protective foil on the back. Such damage will destroy the panel.\n\n6.) Attach the solar connectors to the panel. This avoids ground contact and provides good weather protection. This can be done very easily by threading cable ties through the plugs and the junction box. {% include figure image_path=“../images/battery_box/07_solar_plugs.jpg” alt=“Attach the solar connectors to the panel.” %}  7.) Finally, the box should be secured against unauthorized or accidental opening. For this purpose there is a steel cable with a number lock, which is to be attached in the way it is placed there."
