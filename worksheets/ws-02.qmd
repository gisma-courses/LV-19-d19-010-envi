After the first attempts - specifically after the technical example simulations, a first review of the available literature as well as a rough structuring of the research questions, it is now necessary to design a concrete approach.



## Goals 

After the first attempts - specifically after the technical example simulations, a first review of the available literature as well as a rough structuring of the research questions, it is now necessary to design a concrete approach.


## Things you need

* [Course Data Server](https://hessenbox.uni-marburg.de/getlink/fi5p6EzMUrtUVFW3DnkFky/envimet) You will find here all kinds of data, literature and tutorials 
* [ENVI-met software](https://envi-met.info/doku.php?id=start)
* Please have a look at the **Monde Tutorial videos**

## Assignment
Design a concrete problem and a suitable associated modeling concept to assess the performance of Envimet to simulate essential microclimatic parameters in the specific setup of the Carolinen Haus.  Consider the following aspects:
* abiotic endowment of the model domain (relief, soil, site location).
* biotic features of the model domain (simple/3D vegetation)
* technical model domain (x,y,z extent, time steps nesting)
* appropriate meteorology for model initialization (ideal, real values)
* Validation strategy


* Work packages - What is to be done when and by whom?
 * WP 1 technical and abiotic modell
 * WP 2 meteo data initialization
 * WP 3 Vegetation "simple
 * WP 4 Vegetation "3D
 * WP 5 Validation strategy



The task is then as follows:

The resulting concept should be prepared as a table (similar to the below example), also addressing the literature/data  used as well as know shortcomings.

### Workpackage 1

| item | solution | references | ressources needed | lead | team |
|:-------:|:--------|:---------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| relief | build-in version xy | online access | ? | ? | ? |
| soil properties | soil data  | access has to be clarified |  who knows| ? | ? |
| soil vertical structure | four levels temperature soil moisture build-in model| envi-met | ? | ? | ? |
|... |... |... |... |... |... |


Any written notes please put them on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/mqXJIO7n/modellierung-envimet) in the board for this course. 

It is strongly recommended that 1 Person take the lead for a specific workpackage and find 1 or more collaborators 
{: .notice--success}

* Please upload /write the tables and necessary notes/explanations on cards.
* Please prepare the GIS data and upload it to thje [Hessenbox](https://hessenbox.uni-marburg.de/getlink/fi5p6EzMUrtUVFW3DnkFky/envimet).
